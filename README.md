SeaChainBuilder

Creating the grid:

1. Enter the height 
2. Enter the width
3. Press "Create" button
TIP: Keep the height and width equal numbers.
This will create the grid, it will seem blank once created until you fill it with textures.

Creating Textures:
1. Enter the texture name
2. Enter the ID
3. Select a appropriate colour.
4. Click add texture.
This will add the textures to the list above. The texture name is irrelevant and only used in the builder. 
Same goes for the colour. Only helped for builder visualization.

Removing Textures:
1. Click the texture in the list  
2. Click your Delete (DEL) key.

Using Textures:
1. Create the grid (See above)
2. Add Textures (See above)
3. Select the texture from the list.
4. Left click the cell in the grid you'd like to change.
You will have to wiggle the mouse around while left clicking to place the texture. 
This is due to the grid using the mouse "Move" event and not the click event.

Adding Tags:
1. Create grid.
2. Right click the cell you want to attach a tag to. (You should see the position textbox update with the x and y)
3. Enter the tag.
4. Click Add tag button.
TIP: Use one words and no spaces when using a tag system.
Similar to Using Textures you will have to wiggle around the mouse to select a cell.

To save everything.
1. Simply click the "Save" Button.
2. Go to the default directory.
3. "map.txt" for the map file and "tag.txt" for the tags file.
Note: Everytime you save it will overrite these 2 files.
Debugging location: "SeaChainBuilder.UI>bin>Debug>netcoreapp3.1>"tags.txt" or "map.txt"
